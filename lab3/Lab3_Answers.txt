Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Suppose we relocated the three buttons from group B, bits 5-3 to
group D, bits 5-3, noting that the LED is still attached to group D, bit
2. Assuming appropriate DDRD values, consider the following method of turning
on the LED.

    PORTD = 0x04; // turn on the LED

Explain the problem with this approach and, in particular, what would stop
working after the execution of that line of code.

    Since we are now using group D bits 5-3 as inputs, we need to initialize the pullup resistors of those
	corresponding bits by setting PORT3, PORT4, PORT5 as 1. This approach is problematic because it sets 
	all bits of group D to 0 other than bit 2 which is set to 1. Therefore, all 3 pullup resistors are not
	set up correctly. Without pullup resistors, when switch is closed (pressed), Vdd is directly connected
	to the ground so that there is a short circuit. As a result, when the switch is pressed, the LED will
	not flash.
	




2. (2 points) Briefly explain why the delay between the press of the 'C' button
and the start of the LED on/off sequence varied when you took multiple
measurements?  Think about the timing of how software executes.
	Because of while(1), the program infinitively loops over the 3 if statements. By the time we press 'C',
	we actually don't know which if statement the program is currently checking. So the delay varies. For
	example, if the program just finished the last checking of 'C' and is now checking back to 'U', then it
	takes longer(higher delay) to check 'C' than if the program just finished checking 'S'(so that the next
	immediate letter is 'C').
