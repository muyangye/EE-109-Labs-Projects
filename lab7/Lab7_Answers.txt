		    Lab 7 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 point) Briefly explain why it is undesirable to read the two encoder
input signals with two separate PINC statements.
    When we are in ISR reading an input, let's say a, but meanwhile
	we are twisting the rotary encoder so that b changes, if we read
	a and b separately, b will become the new value when a is being
	read. So we permantenly lost the original b's value. We should use
	the original value because we are using gray codes which only change
	1 bit at a time (in this case, a).


2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.
	Because updating LCD display takes time. The whole point of ISR is very
	fast emergency handling so that we can go back to normal routine without
	any loss of track. However, if we update LCD display in ISR, we may miss
	values changed when we are updating.
