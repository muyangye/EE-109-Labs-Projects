Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (1 points) Briefly explain why a common GND signal is needed between
transmitter and receiver devices.
	Because a common GND provides the same low voltage reference for
	transmitter and receiver.




2. (2 points) The baud rate (e.g. 9600 bps) is the rate at which 1's and 0's
are transmitted over the serial line.  Briefly explain why the data rate (rate
at which useful data is transmitted/received) is less than the baud rate even
with error-free transmission.
	Because we need to send the start and stop bits so that Arduinos know when
	to transmit/receive message, and those bits make the actual rate less.
